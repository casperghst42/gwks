# Groupwise KickStart

### No longer under development, nor will I ever do anything with it. Fork it and enjoy your self.

Last time I looked at this was back in 2000 or 2001, and I only put it here for someone to look at - if they want to see crappy code. The world has sadly moved on from Groupwise.

This was a tool to easily start the Groupwise Client with different start parameters to select either different system or remote postbox. 

It was written with Borland C++, I can't remember the version, but it was one of the last ones released, also another great company which has left us.
